# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description 

UX and Advanced CSS: Bootstrap Portfolio

### Requirments compleated:
Below is a list of requirements for the Bootstrap Portfolio project that I have completed:

- A navigation bar with a menu at the top. I used the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation and included links to applicable sections of my portfolio.
- A hero section with a jumbotron featuring my picture, name, and other relevant information.
- A work section that displays my projects in a grid using Bootstrap cards. Each project has a brief description and links to my class project work.
- A skills section where I listed out the skills I expect to learn from the boot camp.
- An about/contact section with an About Me section in the same row.
- A footer section with hyperlinks that have a hover effect and buttons that display a box shadow upon hover.
- My Bootstrap solution minimizes the use of media queries.
- I deployed my new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
